# Cross - Earthquake Visualization

An interactive real-time earthquake visualization that displays global seismic activity on a world map with animated crosshairs tracking each event.

Earthquake data is fetched from United States Geological Surveys Earthquake API, and contains all earthquakes detected by USGS during last 30 days.

The project is hosted [here](https://quakes.netlify.app) (Won't look good on mobile)

## Why did I build this?

Few years ago I saw an art exhibition by Ryoji Ikeda (one of these probably https://amosrex.fi/en/exhibitions/ryoji-ikeda-2/) where one of the exhibits had a visualization with crosshair moving over a map, and I wanted to try to create same kind of effect.
